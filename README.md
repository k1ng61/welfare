# welfare

Making the world a more healthier and happier place.

In this constantly stressful environment, Welfare keeps people both physically
and mentally fit. There are four main features in the app. One of which is doing a workout (with spotify). While you're
performing your exercise, our AI trainer will classify what exercise you're doing and also count your reps.
Another feature is meditation, in which you're walked through a meditation session. The third feature is a donation.
Using the galileo api, you're able to donate to people in need. The last feature is just a document with
mental health resources.
